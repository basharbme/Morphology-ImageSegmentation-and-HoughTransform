# Morphology-ImageSegmentation-and-HoughTransform
Perform Morphology image processing, Image Segmentation and point detection. Perform Hough transform to detect all the vertical lines

**University at Buffalo - CSE573: Computer Vision and Image Processing**

### Overview
* Morphology Image Processing
  * Use two morphology image processing algorithms to remove noises of the image.
  * Using morphology image processing algorithms to extract the boundary.
  
* Image Segmentation and point detection
  * The ‘point.jpg’ is a X-ray image of a turbine blade with a porosity. Using the point detection algorithm, label the points and give its (if more than one their) coordinates on the image.
  * Choose an optimal threshold to segment the object from background by thresholding on ‘segment.jpg’.
 
* Hough Transform
  * Utilizing the Hough transformation, design and implement an algorithm to detect all vertical (red lines)
  * Detect all the coins
